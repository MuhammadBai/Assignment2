# Assignment2 : Shell Scripting

## Overview
In this assignment, i have developed two shell scripting projects which automates system setup tasks and user managment on an Arch Linux environment. The scripts follows the best practices, focusing on error handling, documentation, and utilizing 'getopts' for command=line options.

---

## Project 1: System Setup Scripts

### Purpose
This project automates the installation of essential software packages and creates symbolic links to configuration files stored in a remote Git repository. It speeds uo the sustem setup process, making it fast and repeatable.

## 1.`packages_list`
 This script generates a list of software packages that will be installed during setup which are kakoune and tmux.
 
 * **Purpose**: This automates the creation of a list (`pkgs.txt`) which contains names of software packages to install.
 * **Function**: This adds each specified package to `pkgs.txt` and prints the package name on the console for confirmation.
 * **Its Uses**: 
          1. make the script excutable with `chmod +x packages_list`   
          2. show you if it works by the command `sudo ./packages_list`
          3. this will generate the list of kakoune and tmux in the `pkgs.txt` file. 
 * It creates a lists of packages inside pkgs.txt file.

 ## 2.`PKGS`
This script installs all packages in pkgs.txt using the pacman package manager.

* **Purpose**: It makes the installation of multiple packagess simple by reading it from `pkgs.txt` file.
* **Function**: 
    * It checks if the script is run as root which is necessary for package installation.
    * It verifies the existence of pkgs.txt and reads package names from it.
    * Then it installs each package, outputs each package name as it installs, and tells you if a package fails to install.
* **It Uses**: 
        1. make the script executable with `chmod +x PKGS`
        2.`sudo ./PKGS`
        3. After running it, this will read the `packages_list` script to install the packages it see in the `pkgs.txt` file.
* **Dependencies**: It requires `pkgs.txt` to be in the same directory.

## 3.`pkgs.txt`
A text file listing the packages to install which is used by PKGS script.
* **Purpose**: It provides a lsit of package names for installation.
* **Format**: Each package name is listed on a new line.
* **Example**: 
```
kakoune
tmux
```
* **It Uses**: 
    * `pkgs.txt` is generated by `packages_list` and read by `PKGS`.
    *  you can see the two packages kakoune and tmux after running `packages_list` script.

## 4.`symlink`:
    This script creates shortcuts (called "symbolic links") for your configuration files. These shortcuts let you easily access the files from standard locations on your system like `~/bin` or `~/.config`.

* **Purpose**: It organizes your configuration files so they are easy to access and in consistent place.
* **What it does**:
    * It creates the needed folder (like `~/bin` and `~/.config/kak`) if they are not ther yet.
    * It sets up links for specific config files like for kakoune, Tmux, and `.bashrc`.
    * It shows a confirmation message when the links are created.
* **How to Use**:
            1. make it executable by `chmod +x symlink`
            2. `sudo ./symlink` will tell you wether the symbolic links are created or not. 

## 5. `setup`:
This is the main script that runs the entire setup process.

* **Purpose**: 
    This is the main setup that runs the entire process.
* **What it does**:
    * Shows a message that setup is installing.
    * Runs the `PKGS` script to install packages.
    * This runs the `symlink` script to set up config file links.
    * Prints a message when setup is complete.
* **How to use**:
        1. make the script executable `chmod +x setup`
        2. install the packages by running `sudo ./setup`

# Setup Instructions
Run `packages_list` to create `pkgs.txt` with the packages you want to install:
    `./packages_list`

# Run Setup
Run `setup` to install the packages and set up links for the configuration files:
    `sudo ./setup`


# Requirements:
    * Arch linux Operating System.
    * To run `PKGS` and `setup` (for installing packages) you need root access.
    * `pacman` package manager should be installed and setup.


**you can edit `pkgs.txt` to add any additional package you need.**
